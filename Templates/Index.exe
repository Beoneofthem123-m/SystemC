tlm_at_backpressure  ...  Modification of 4 phase handshake with a buffer size of 8, regular socket, no interconnect, Initiator randomly writes and read the buffer inside the target.
tlm_simple_socket     ...  Simple socket no dynamic for Ini and Targ, simple socket no dynamic in vector template for Interconnect, With routing Map, 4 Phase handshake, Target has buffer for backpressure, Initiator writes N time then reads N times.
tlm_multipassthrough_socket ...  Simple socket no dynamic for Ini and Targ, Simple socket dynamic for Interconnect, with routing Map, 4 phase handshake, Target has buffer for backpressure, Initiator writes N time then reads N times.
tlm_payload_extension ... Simple socket no dynamic for Ini and Targ, Simple socket dynamic for Interconnect, with Payload extension for routing, 4 phase handshake, Target has buffer for backpressure, Initiator writes N time then reads N times.
tlm_at_multipassthroughSimpleSocketBackpressureBufferPayloadExtension  ... Initiator reads N time only


Exercise2 ... Part1  NAND module (nand_main.cpp) -  XOR module using NAND (xor_main.cpp), Part3 debugging tracing and clock signal added to mon and stim to generate inputs.
Exercise3 ...  State machine for detecting sequence of string, using stringInput and clock as inputs and printing whenever i reach the final state.
Exercise4  .... Petrinet using custom interface/channel as Place and SC_MODULES as transitions. Part 1 create interface - chanel and module, Part 2 Transition module are now templated and dynamic indicating # of input and output, Part 4 now placeChannel is also templated indicatin input and output weights, Part 6 modify the template of the transitions to add inhibitors also dynamicly and create a subnet modeling the state of a memory and then putting two of the same ones toggether in a toplevel
Exercise5 ...  State machine containing Add - Split and Delay using sc_fifo
